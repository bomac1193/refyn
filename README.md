# Refyn

> **"Create The Unseen"**

## The Problem

AI image generation has democratized visual creation — but introduced a new bottleneck: **the prompt**.

- **The skill gap is brutal.** Crafting effective prompts takes months to learn. Most users never get there.
- **Every platform speaks a different language.** Midjourney syntax doesn't work on DALL-E. Leonardo needs different keywords than Runway.
- **Your taste is invisible to the tool.** You know what you want. The AI doesn't. Every session starts from zero.
- **Iteration is endless.** Without feedback loops, users regenerate blindly, wasting time and credits.

The result: millions of creators trapped between their vision and what they can articulate.

---

## Who This Is For

- Obsessives who regenerate 50 times to get it right
- Creators who have a vision and refuse to compromise
- People who treat prompting as a craft, not a chore

## Who This Is Not For

- "Good enough" people
- One-prompt-and-done users
- Anyone who thinks AI does the creative work

---

## What Refyn Does

- Learns your taste until it knows what you want before you do
- Translates your intent across every platform
- Gets out of your way

## What Refyn Doesn't Do

- Hand-hold beginners through their first prompt
- Make mediocre ideas look good
- Apologize for being opinionated

## Guiding Policy

**Invisible Intelligence**
> The best tool is one you forget you're using.

Refyn enhances without interrupting. It appears when needed, learns silently, optimizes seamlessly. Your creative flow stays unbroken.

**Taste is Personal**
> Never impose; always learn.

No "correct" style. Refyn observes what you save, like, and trash — then adapts. Your Refyn becomes uniquely yours.
