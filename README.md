# Refyn

> **"Create The Unseen"**

---

## The Problem

AI image generation has democratized visual creation — but introduced a new bottleneck: **the prompt**.

- **The skill gap is brutal.** Crafting effective prompts takes months to learn. Most users never get there.
- **Every platform speaks a different language.** Midjourney syntax doesn't work on DALL-E. Leonardo needs different keywords than Runway.
- **Your taste is invisible to the tool.** You know what you want. The AI doesn't. Every session starts from zero.
- **Iteration is endless.** Without feedback loops, users regenerate blindly, wasting time and credits.

The result: millions of creators trapped between their vision and what they can articulate.

## Guiding Policy

**Invisible Intelligence**
> The best tool is one you forget you're using.

Refyn enhances without interrupting. It appears when needed, learns silently, optimizes seamlessly. Your creative flow stays unbroken.

**Taste is Personal**
> Never impose; always learn.

No "correct" style. Refyn observes what you save, like, and trash — then adapts. Your Refyn becomes uniquely yours.

## Strategy

Refyn is the **taste layer** between human intent and AI generation.

**Universal Coverage**
Works across Midjourney, DALL-E, Leonardo, Runway, Ideogram, Flux, Kling, Pika, Luma — and extensible to any platform.

**Deep Taste Learning**
Tracks your preferences through behavior: saves, likes, trashes with reasons. Builds a personal preference model that improves every suggestion.

**Frictionless Integration**
Chrome extension with floating panel. Grab prompts, enhance them, insert them — without leaving the page.

## Features

**Floating Panel** (Ctrl+Shift+E)
- Compact, draggable panel on any webpage
- Modes: Enhance, Expand, Simplify, Platform-optimize
- Preset styles: Cinematic, Photorealistic, Anime, etc.

**Taste Learning**
- Positive signals from saved prompts and liked outputs
- Negative signals from trashed outputs with feedback
- Keyword scoring that weights your preferences

**Platform Intelligence**
- Auto-detects which platform you're on
- Handles platform-specific syntax (--ar, --v, --weird for Midjourney)
- Consistent experience everywhere
